       "\"At Peppy, I was involved in several key activities:\\n\\n1. I aided in the integration of the Peppy web app with the Peppy AI API, which involved working with LangChain and OpenAI technologies.\\n2. I played a significant role in ensuring the quality of the software by utilizing TypeScript and emphasizing the importance of sharing types across the entire stack. Specifically, I led efforts to improve the integration of types within the Admin Panel, tightening up the contract between the front-end and the API. This included making sure that data loading at the page or form level adhered to the TypeScript types and Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) shared by the API.\\n3. A core part of my role was to address the lack of tests in the system. I introduced a high level of test coverage to ensure confidence in the system's robustness against refactoring changes. My approach to testing was two-fold:\\n   - I wrote component tests for new UI components, which were created in Storybook and tested using Jest or Cypress Component Tests.\\n   - I also wrote Cypress end-to-end tests for the majority of the admin panel to ensure the entire system worked as expected from start to finish.\""
