# Next.js Experience

Next.js is one of my two selected frameworks to sepcialise in, Remix being the other.

I have been using Next.js for a number of years and I have to say it is getting better and better. I'm a big fan of the more recent changes to the App Router, React Server Components and Server Actions. This brings it inline with the philosophy of Remix and I think it is a great move.

In terms of experience with Next.js this AI CV is building using the latest version of Next.js, using App Router & React Server Components with the Vercel AI SDK.

In a commercial context I most recently used Next.js at Eruptiv whilst building a marketing template for a SaaS recruitment product. A greenfield project I got to architect from the ground up it made use of Next.j App Router, React Server Components & Server Actions.

I also integrated Vercel preview deployments and utilised the Vercel Toolbar to obtain client feedback on the progress of the project.
