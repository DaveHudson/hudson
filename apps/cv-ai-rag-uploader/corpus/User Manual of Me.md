## Conditions I like to work in

Having worked remotely for over 10 years, it is definitely not an open plan office!

I'm generally most productive in my home office paired with multiple monitors and a cup of Yorkshire tea. That said, I sometimes need to vary the working conditions depending on my mood or the kind of work I'm doing.

Often I want some music playing or a bit of background radio. If I catch myself losing focus and being unproductive it's usually the sign to pack up the laptop to get some fresh air and a change of scene. Most often I'll have a short walk on Durham's riverbanks en-route to a coffee shop and spend an hour or so working there before returning to the home office.

I work best in short bursts followed by short breaks but for some reason I rarely do this ðŸ¤”

If I've a good seat and strong phone signal I'm also quite productive on the LNER to London train. Despite the single screen there is something about the lack of interruptions that makes the 3 hours pass quicker and I get a fair bit done.

## The times/hours I like to work

I generally stick to the 9-5 routine to align with family life. I'm generally most productive in the mornings so frequently start around 8am when home life doesn't get in the way.

I like to try and take an hour for lunch and get out for a walk when I can to refresh my mind.

I sometimes start flagging around 4pm and / or get distracted by the family to cook tea, in which case I pop back online about 6pm for a bit to wrap up my day.

I can be fairly productive on a short evening work stint but it is usually frowned upon ðŸ˜†

## The best ways to communicate with me

Not JIRA ðŸ¤£ otherwise I don't really mind. I probably lean towards Slack whether that is async chat or a huddle or a video call.

I tend to keep up to date with Slack messages at various points throughout the day and respond quite quickly.

In an effort to have work / life boundaries I don't have email or Slack on my phone, so if there is an urgent issue outside of core hours, best to pick up the phone and give me a call.

## What motivates me

In the words of Dan Pink "Autonomy, mastery & purpose".

- Remote working paired with the right company culture gives _autonomy_
- Understanding the big picture & how all the parts of the system work together helps with the _mastery_ and defying the imposter syndrome
- Working on things that make a real difference in peoples lives, like Peppy, provides _purpose_

## The ways I like to receive feedback

Early and often. If it's more nuanced, better to have a call to discuss or screen share over Slack.

## Things I need

Minimal meetings / distractions so I can focus. That said... I also need clarity on the work to be done, so seems I also need meetings ðŸ¤”

As is the way with these things it's the right balance. I don't need detailed requirements but do need shared understanding and big picture agreement on the work to be done.

I depend on [Obsidian](<[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)>) a lot, mostly as a brain dump because my memory is like a sieve. I use the daily note feature at the start of each day to work out my todo list, though I rarely complete everything on it!

Pen, paper & post-its also feature highly.

## Things I struggle with

- Imposter syndrome, it's always real in tech
- Large remote meetings
- Lack of real communication, no big picture, no story map
- Unclear requirements and priorities
- Unsustainable pace of work, I burn out

## Things I love

- Family
- Food
- Football

## Other things to know about me

- When it comes to food I'm:
  - Anti processed foods
  - Plant-based, mostly vegan apart from the eggs
  - Have a life goal of making top notch Sourdough bread, I've yet to achieve it!
- I play guitar (mostly past tense and blues)
- The view from my office is alright
