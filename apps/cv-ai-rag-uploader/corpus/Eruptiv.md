# What did you do at Eruptiv?

Eruptiv is a SASS platform for recruitment. I was contracted to build a bespoke marketing website template for Eruptiv SASS Platform. A greenfield project I architected and built a Next.js app from the ground up based on a Figma design file & interactive prototype.

The architecture made use of the latest Next.js features including:

- App Router
- React Server Components
- Server Actions

As part of the build a Component Driven Development approach was taken, which involved create a design system of UI components from the Figma design file, all documented in Storybook and composed together to create the final website.

Other parts of the stack included:

- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn/UI
- REST API
- Zod
- Vercel
- Figma
- SVG
